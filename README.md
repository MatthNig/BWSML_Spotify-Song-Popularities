# BWSML Project: Predicting Spotify Song Popularities

This project was developed for the Bern Winter School on Machine Learning, which was organized by the Mathematical Institute of the University of Bern (Switzerland). It builds on a dataset that contains descriptive information of over 14'000 unique songs from *Spotify*. With this data, Neural Networks are trained to predict whether a specific song is a popular song.

This repository features a presentation of the results as well as the data and code that has been used for this project. 

Note that this is a fun project with no real meaning. It's purpose was to try out Neural Networks and Tensorflow.

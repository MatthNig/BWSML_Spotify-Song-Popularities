# BWSML Project: Predicting **Spotify** Song Popularities

This project was developed for the Bern Winter School on Machine Learning from the Mathematical Institute of the University of Bern (Switzerland). It builds on a dataset that contains desctiptive information of over unique 14'000 songs from Spotify. With this data, Neural Networks are trained to predict whether a specific song is a popular song.

This repository features a presentation of the results as well as the data and code that has been used for this project. 

The project is a fun project with no deeper meaning. It's purpose was to try out Neural Networks and Tensorflow.
